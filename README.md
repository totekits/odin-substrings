## Assignment
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument.<br>
It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.<br>
Make sure the method can handle multiple words.
